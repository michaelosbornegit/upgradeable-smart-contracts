# upgradeable-smart-contracts
The purpose of this repository is to test different methods of handling upgradeability and deprecation of smart contracts on a blockchain.

Each folder is a separate approach and each has it's own README explaining how to make it go.

I use [Truffle](https://truffleframework.com/docs/truffle/overview) as my smart contract development environment and I recommend you do too. If you want to test these approaches on your own private network without using truffles super-easy super-powerful testing and deployment tools, everything you need is in contracts/ in each subfolder.

**Happy Upgrading!**
